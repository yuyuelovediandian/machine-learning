Representation Multivariate Distribution
  1. what is the joint probability distribution on multiplevariables?   Exponential patameters/need to to be represented all?
  2. Factored representation: chain-rule      polynomial parameters/save cost


Two types of GMs
  1. Directed edges give causality relationships (Bayesian Network or Directed Graphical Model)
      p(x1,x2,x3,x4) = p(x1) * p(x2|x1) * p(x3|x2) * p(x4|x2,x3)
  2. Undirected edges simply give correlations between variables (Markov Random Field or Undirected Graphical model):
      p(x1,x2,x3,x4) = 1/z exp{E(x1) + E(x2,x1) + E(x3,x2) + E(x4,x2,x3)}

Bayesian Network:Factorization Theorem
  Given a DAG, the most general form of the probability distribution that is consistent with the graph factors 
  accorrding the "node given its parents" :
          P(X) =
