Representation Multivariate Distribution
  1. what is the joint probability distribution on multiplevariables?   Exponential patameters/need to to be represented all?
  2. Factored representation: chain-rule      polynomial parameters/save cost


Two types of GMs
  1. Directed edges give causality relationships (Bayesian Network or Directed Graphical Model)
      p(x1,x2,x3,x4) = p(x1) * p(x2|x1) * p(x3|x2) * p(x4|x2,x3)
  2. Undirected edges simply give correlations between variables (Markov Random Field or Undirected Graphical model):
